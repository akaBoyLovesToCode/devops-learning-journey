## The Pheonix Project

What Paige said also impressed me a lot. I’ve been unhappy since something similar to what happened to Bill happened to me too. Fortunately, I found things I really liked and dedicated myself to them, and I struggled a lot to seize opportunities to break in. Another thing that impressed me is that I’ve been working for about 5 years since 2020, but I never thought about defining categories of work. I learned about the categories “business projects, internal projects, changes, and unplanned work (so-called anti-work),” and I couldn’t agree more with them.



> A great team doesn’t mean that they had the smartest people. What made those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a powerful thing when that magic dynamic exists.

I can’t believe Bill resigned at the end of Part I, but fortunately he finally came back to the team and gained Steve’s apology and trust. I’m also sad that my own team isn’t running well, and I doubt it’s possible to fix things so that we can truly collaborate — managers don’t understand dev and ops at all, and they don’t trust anyone. Teammates only care about their own benefits. We suffer from all five dysfunctions of a team, and I want to leave, but I don’t know if I can find a job with good work-life balance (WLB) and a supportive team. My DevOps skills aren’t strong enough for a job yet. The only problem is that I don’t know who my Erik is. Erik’s identity is a mystery — why he is so outstanding and broadly capable in helping Bill. All right. I AM MY OWN ERIK. Just do it.



> When we have more than one project in the system at the same time, how do we protect the work from being interrupted or having its priority trumped by almost anyone in the business or someone else in IT?

I doubt that this problem still exists nowadays. I saw a senior SRE engineer say that the owners of business projects usually urge him repeatedly to speed things up.
