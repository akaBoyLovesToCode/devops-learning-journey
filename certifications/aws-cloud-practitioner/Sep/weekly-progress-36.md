## The Pheonix Project

*What Paige said also impressed me a lot. I’ve been unhappy since something similar to what happened to Bill happened to me too. Fortunately, I found things I really liked and dedicated myself to them, and I struggled a lot to seize opportunities to break in. Another thing that impressed me is that I’ve been working for about 5 years since 2020, but I never thought about defining categories of work. I learned about the categories “business projects, internal projects, changes, and unplanned work (so-called anti-work),” and I couldn’t agree more with them.*
