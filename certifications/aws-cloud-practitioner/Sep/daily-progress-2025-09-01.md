## Ps

​        Recently, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I often stay up too late and don’t spend enough time with my family. But I really want to find a job that feels meaningful. Right now, I don’t know what I’m doing or why I have to keep doing this seemingly meaningless work every day — especially in an offline environment that drives me crazy, since it’s so inconvenient for using tools (like uv) and downloading the libraries I need. Writing a diary after studying and taking notes also makes me too tired to keep going…

​        **So, I’ve decided not to keep a diary every day. Instead, I’ll commit to writing at least once a week.**

​        Keep moving forward~
