# Daily Progress - 2025-08-26

## AWS Cloud Practitioner Progress
**Course**: [AWS Foundations: Getting Started with the Cloud Essentials](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/GTVN1YVH4J/aws-foundations-getting-started-with-the-aws-cloud-essentials/JE4XVHC56M)

### ✅ Completed Today
Despite working overtime again today, I successfully completed the remaining modules of the AWS Foundations course.

## Phase 0 Status
**Reading**: *The Phoenix Project* -- Chapter 5

## Today's Progress Diary
### The Phoenix Project
Chapter 4 of *The Phoenix Project* revealed additional aspects of IT Operations beyond firefighting: cleaning up issues created by the development team, which further emphasizes the importance of collaboration between Development and Operations.

What I found particularly concerning is that Bill is trying his best to save the Phoenix project and the entire IT Operations department, but few people seem to understand or support him. CEO Steve promoted him to VP of IT during the company's most challenging period, yet doesn't appear to fully trust him. Even worse, Bill's team lacks cohesion—disagreements between Patty and others (like Wes) require careful handling. This situation is well captured in the original text:

> Before, I was merely worried that IT Operations was under attack by Development, Information Security, Audit, and the business. Now, I'm starting to realize that my primary managers seem to be at war with each other as well.

I'm not particularly optimistic about Bill's chances of success, though I certainly hope he can turn things around. We'll have to wait and see how this develops.

Additionally, compliance emerged as a new theme today. This is something I haven't encountered in my previous work with smaller development teams.

### AWS Foundations

#### Networking
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud - functions as an isolated network environment within AWS
- **Route 53**: AWS's DNS service, similar to Cloudflare's DNS offerings
- **ELB**: Elastic Load Balancer - AWS's native load balancing solution, comparable to nginx

#### Security
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Clear division of security responsibilities between AWS and customers
- **AWS Security Services**: IAM (Identity and Access Management), AWS Artifact, AWS KMS (Key Management Service), AWS Shield

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Day (No Internet)**: Read *The Phoenix Project* - Chapter 6
