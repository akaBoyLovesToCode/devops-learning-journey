##  Phoenix Project Insights
Today I completed the first 3 chapters of *The Phoenix Project*, which vividly illustrates the critical disconnect between development and operations teams at Parts Unlimited. The story reveals how developers frequently bypass established processes when making production changes, resulting in significant operational disruptions and financial losses for the company.

This narrative highlights one of the core challenges that DevOps aims to address: establishing safe, reliable change management processes for production environments. The fundamental question raised is whether modern DevOps practices truly achieve this goal of seamless, risk-managed transitions between development and production, or if they merely represent an evolved form of traditional IT operations with better tooling.

My first impression of the book is quite engaging, and I'm looking forward to continuing with the next chapters tomorrow.

##  Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Day (No Internet)**: Read *The Phoenix Project* - Chapter 4,5,6
