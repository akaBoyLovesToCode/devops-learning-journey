# Runbooks Directory

This directory contains operational runbooks - documented procedures for operating and troubleshooting the systems built during the learning journey.

##  What are Runbooks?

Runbooks are step-by-step guides for common operational tasks:
- **Deployment procedures**: How to deploy new versions
- **Monitoring checks**: What to monitor and how to interpret metrics
- **Troubleshooting guides**: How to diagnose and fix common issues
- **Recovery procedures**: How to restore service during outages
- **Maintenance tasks**: Routine operational activities

##  Learning Value

### Operational Experience
Runbooks demonstrate:
- Understanding of production operational requirements
- Ability to document procedures for team use
- Troubleshooting methodology and systematic thinking
- Production readiness mindset

### Interview Preparation
- Ready examples of operational thinking
- Stories about solving production issues
- Understanding of SRE principles in practice
- Experience with real-world operational challenges

##  Creating Runbooks

### When to Create Runbooks
- After successful deployment of a new component
- When encountering and solving operational issues
- For routine maintenance tasks performed regularly
- When setting up monitoring and alerting

### Best Practices
- Write runbooks **before** they are needed
- Test procedures end-to-end
- Include concrete commands and examples
- Document assumptions and prerequisites
- Include validation steps to confirm success
- Review and update runbooks regularly

##  Example Runbook Topics

1. **Deploying Lambda Function via CI/CD**
2. **Investigating High Lambda Invocation Latency**
3. **Troubleshooting API Gateway 5xx Errors**
4. **DynamoDB Capacity Planning and Scaling**
5. **CloudWatch Alarm Configuration and Testing**
6. **IAM Policy Troubleshooting and Debugging**
7. **Cost Anomaly Investigation Procedures**
8. **Security Incident Response Checklist**
9. **Backup and Restore Procedures**
10. **Performance Benchmarking Runbook**

## Tools and Integration

### Command Examples
Include actual commands used:
```bash
# Check Lambda function status
aws lambda get-function --function-name my-bot-function

# View CloudWatch logs
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/my-bot-function

# Check DynamoDB metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/DynamoDB \
  --metric-name ConsumedReadCapacityUnits
```

### Integration with Monitoring
- Reference specific CloudWatch dashboards
- Include links to relevant metrics
- Connect with alerting systems
- Provide escalation paths
