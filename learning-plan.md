* # DevOps/SRE Learning Plan

  My plan to get from current skills to AWS DevOps Professional, centered around a hands-on bot project with optimized AWS learning paths.

  ---

  ### Phase 0: Foundation – Problem-Solving Mindset (Weeks 1–2)

  **Goal:** Build system design thinking and understand WHY DevOps exists.

  **Reading:**

  - *The Phoenix Project* → **Focus on:** Why firefighting fails, how system design prevents issues
  - *Emily Wood's IaC essay* → Why automation matters more than tools
  - */u/mdaffin's comment* → DevOps is problem-solving mindset, not tool mastery

  **Practical Foundation:**
  - **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** (12h 45m) → But focus on CONCEPTS, not memorization
  - **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** → Start documenting WHY you choose each solution
  - **Target:** Understand trade-offs, not just pass exams

  **Project: Home Lab Bot v0.1**
  1. Platform: Telegram, Slack, or Discord
  2. Task: Build a simple Python "Echo Bot"
  3. Run it locally. Understand the app vs. infra separation

  **Certification Target:** Pass AWS Cloud Practitioner exam by end of Phase 0

  **Outcome:** DevOps concepts understood. Simple bot running locally with solid AWS foundation.

  ### Phase 1: First Cloud Deployment – Building Blocks (Weeks 2–4)

  **Goal:** Deploy a minimum viable system on AWS. Practice basic observability.

  **Mindset:**
  - *The DevOps Handbook* → Focus on Continuous Delivery & Automation principles
  - Think "Why IaC?" → Avoid the console for repeatable tasks

  **Optimized Coursework:**
  - **NoSQL Foundational Learning Plan** (11h 10m) → Covers DynamoDB + Lambda integration perfectly
  - Focus on: DynamoDB, Lambda, and basic IAM from this plan
  - **Target:** Build foundation for SysOps Administrator Associate exam

  **Project: Bot v0.2**
  1. Deploy the bot to AWS Lambda + API Gateway
  2. Use DynamoDB for state (chat history)
  3. Check logs with CloudWatch
  4. Basic IAM setup for least privilege

  **Certification Target:** Prepare for SysOps Administrator Associate exam

  **Outcome:** Bot is live on AWS. Basic observability working. State is persistent. Strong NoSQL foundation.

  ### Phase 2: Architecture Comparison – Multiple Solutions (Weeks 4–8)

  **Goal:** Learn to evaluate trade-offs between different approaches. Build architectural thinking.

  **Mindset:**
  - *Google SRE Book* → Focus on reliability patterns, not just automation
  - **Key Question:** "What problems does this solve, and what new problems does it create?"

  **Multi-Cloud Approach:**
  - **AWS:** Continue with Cloud Operator (SysOps) Learning Plan focus
  - **Alternative Experiments:**
    - Try same bot on Google Cloud Run (serverless comparison)
    - Deploy same bot on traditional VPS (DigitalOcean/Linode)
    - Container vs. VM vs. Serverless trade-off analysis

  **Project: Bot v1.0 (Architecture Explorer)**
  1. **Three Deployment Methods:**
     - AWS Lambda + DynamoDB (serverless)
     - Docker container on VM (traditional)
     - Kubernetes pod (if relevant to job market)
  2. **Document Trade-offs:** Cost, complexity, maintenance, scaling
  3. **Automation:** IaC for all three approaches
  4. **Monitoring:** Compare observability approaches across platforms

  **Interview Preparation:**
  - Create detailed comparison document: "When I would choose X over Y and why"
  - Practice explaining architectural decisions

  **Certification Target:** Pass SysOps Administrator Associate exam by end of Phase 2

  **Outcome:** Multi-platform architectural thinking with automated deployment pipelines and comprehensive monitoring.

  ### Phase 3: Architect's Playground – Containers & Advanced Patterns (Weeks 8+)

  **Goal:** Explore container architecture vs. serverless. Learn advanced observability and operational patterns.

  **Mindset:**
  - *Site Reliability Workbook*, *Unicorn Project* → Advanced patterns
  - Tools are not silver bullets. Focus on system design.

  **Optimized Coursework:**
  - Continue with remaining **Cloud Operator (SysOps) Learning Plan** modules
  - Focus on: ECS, container orchestration, advanced monitoring
  - **Decision Maker Learning Plan** (48h 54m) → For architectural decision-making skills
  - **Target:** Prepare for DevOps Engineer Professional exam

  **Project: Bot v2.0 (Advanced Architecture)**
  1. **Container orchestration:** Deploy on ECS Fargate or experiment with EKS
  2. **Advanced monitoring:** Custom metrics, dashboards, distributed tracing
  3. **Production readiness:** Blue-green deployments, rollback strategies
  4. **Real features:** Add weather API, user preferences, complex state management
  5. **Performance optimization:** Load testing, auto-scaling, cost optimization

  **Certification Target:** Pass DevOps Engineer Professional exam by end of Phase 3

  **Outcome:** Production-ready system with advanced DevOps practices and deep architectural knowledge.

  ### Phase 4: Experience-Based Career Strategy

  **Goal:** Lead with experience and problem-solving ability, not certifications.

  **Portfolio-First Approach:**
  - **GitHub Repository:** Comprehensive documentation of all architectural experiments
  - **Blog Series:** "Why I chose X over Y" for each architectural decision
  - **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Professional documentation of trade-offs
  - **Runbook Creation:** How to troubleshoot each deployment method

  **Optional Certification Strategy:**
  - **Only if budget allows:** SysOps Associate for HR filtering
  - **Focus:** Practical experience trumps certifications
  - **Interview Strategy:** "I haven't worked with X, but I solved similar problems with Y by doing Z"

  **Job Search Strategy:**
  - **Start after Phase 2:** You'll have multi-platform experience + architectural thinking
  - **Lead with:** "I can solve problems across different platforms and explain trade-offs"
  - **Demonstrate:** Problem-solving mindset, not tool expertise
  - **Portfolio talks:** Show comparative analysis, not just "I used AWS"

  ---

  ## Personal Note on Job Hunting:

  - **Start applying after Phase 2** - Multi-platform experience beats single-tool expertise
  - **Lead with problem-solving:** "I evaluated X vs Y and chose Z because..."
  - **Be honest about gaps:** "I haven't used Kubernetes in production, but I understand its trade-offs vs. serverless and can learn it quickly"
  - **Continuous learning on the job** - No one expects you to know everything
  - **Key insight:** Architecture thinking and adaptability matter more than specific tool mastery
