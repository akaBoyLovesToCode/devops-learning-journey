##  Learning Progression

### Phase 0: Echo Bot
**Goal**: Foundational understanding of application vs infrastructure separation
- Simple Python bot running locally
- Basic application architecture
- Development environment setup

### Phase 1: AWS Serverless
**Goal**: First cloud deployment with basic observability
- AWS Lambda + API Gateway deployment
- DynamoDB for state management
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- Basic IAM security practices

### Phase 2: Multi-Cloud Comparison
**Goal**: Architectural thinking and trade-off analysis
- Same application deployed on AWS, GCP, and traditional VPS
- Detailed cost/performance/complexity comparison
- Infrastructure as Code for all platforms
- Comprehensive monitoring across environments

### Phase 3: Production Ready
**Goal**: Advanced DevOps patterns and production readiness
- Container orchestration (ECS/EKS)
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Security hardening and compliance
- Performance optimization

##  Project Metrics

Each project includes:
- **Cost analysis**: Monthly estimated costs
- **Performance metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Complexity assessment**: Maintenance overhead evaluation
- **Learning outcomes**: Skills acquired and insights gained

## Getting Started

1. Start with Phase 0 to build foundational understanding
2. Progress through each phase sequentially
3. Document all decisions and learnings in ADRs
4. Compare approaches and understand trade-offs
5. Focus on the "why" behind each technology choice

*Projects represent hands-on learning, not production systems. Focus is on understanding concepts rather than building perfect applications.*
